# Improvisation Lab

A Python package for practicing musical improvisation through exercises. This package allows users to generate and practice melodic phrases based on music theory principles, offering real-time pitch detection for immediate feedback. Whether you're following chord progressions or practicing intervals, Improvisation Lab helps you improve your musical skills while adhering to musical rules.

Experience Improvisation Lab directly in your browser! Our interactive demo lets you:

- Generate melodic phrases based on chord progressions or intervals
- Practice your pitch accuracy in real-time
- Get instant visual guidance for hitting the right notes

### Web Interface Features
- **Tab Switching**: Easily switch between Interval Practice and Piece Practice using tabs in the web interface. This allows you to seamlessly transition between different practice modes without leaving the page.

### Note
The demo runs on Hugging Face Spaces' free tier, which means:
- Performance might vary depending on server availability
- If you encounter any issues, try refreshing the page or coming back later
- For consistent performance, consider running the package locally


## Features

- Web-based and direct microphone input support
- Real-time pitch detection with FCPE (Fast Context-aware Pitch Estimation)
- Provides real-time feedback on pitch accuracy

### Interval Practice: Features
- Focuses on practicing musical intervals.
- Users can select the interval and direction (up or down) to practice.

### Piece Practice: Features
- Allows users to select a song and practice its chord progressions.
- Generate melodic phrases based on scales and chord progressions.
- Support for multiple scale types:
  - Major
  - Natural minor
  - Harmonic minor
  - Diminished
- Support for various chord types:
  - Major 7th (maj7)
  - Minor 7th (min7)
  - Dominant 7th (dom7)
  - Half-diminished (min7b5)
  - Diminished 7th (dim7)
- Intelligent note selection based on:
  - Chord tones vs non-chord tones
  - Scale degrees
  - Previous note context
- Real-time pitch detection with FCPE (Fast Context-aware Pitch Estimation)
- Web-based and direct microphone input support


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- A working microphone
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management

## Installation
```bash
make install
```

## Quick Start
1. Create your configuration file:

```bash
cp config.yml.example config.yml
```

2.  (Optional) Edit `config.yml` to customize settings like audio parameters and song selection

3. Run the script to start the melody generation and playback (default is web interface):

- Access the web interface at [http://127.0.0.1:7860/](http://127.0.0.1:7860/).

```bash
make run
```

- To run the console interface, use:

```bash
poetry run python main.py --app_type console
```

4. Follow the displayed melody phrases and sing along with real-time feedback

### Configuration

The application can be customized through `config.yml` with the following options:

#### Common Audio Settings
- `sample_rate`: Audio sampling rate (default: 44100 Hz)
- `buffer_duration`: Duration of audio processing buffer (default: 0.2 seconds)
- `note_duration`: How long to display each note during practice (default: 3 seconds)
- `pitch_detector`: Configuration for the pitch detection algorithm
  - `hop_length`: Hop length for the pitch detection algorithm (default: 512)
  - `threshold`: Threshold for the pitch detection algorithm (default: 0.006)
  - `f0_min`: Minimum frequency for the pitch detection algorithm (default: 80 Hz)
  - `f0_max`: Maximum frequency for the pitch detection algorithm (default: 880 Hz)
  - `device`: Device to use for the pitch detection algorithm (default: "cpu")

#### Interval Practice Settings
- `interval`: The interval to practice
  - Example: For a minor second descending interval, the interval value is -1
- `num_problems`: The number of problems to practice

#### Piece Practice Settings
- `selected_song`: Name of the song to practice
- `chord_progressions`: Dictionary of songs and their progressions
  - Format: `[scale_root, scale_type, chord_root, chord_type, duration]`
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    fly_me_to_the_moon:
      - ["A", "natural_minor", "A", "min7", 4]
      - ["A", "natural_minor", "D", "min7", 4]
      - ["C", "major", "G", "dom7", 4]
    ```


## How It Works

### Interval Practice: Melody Generation
The interval practice focuses on improving interval recognition and singing accuracy:
1. Users select the interval and direction (up or down) to practice.
2. The application generates a series of problems based on the selected interval.
3. Real-time feedback is provided to help users match the target interval.
4. The practice session can be customized with the number of problems and note duration.

### Piece Practice: Melody Generation
The melody generation follows these principles:
1. Notes are selected based on their relationship to the current chord and scale.
2. Chord tones have more freedom in movement.
3. Non-chord tones are restricted to moving to adjacent scale notes.
4. Phrases are connected naturally by considering the previous note.
5. All generated notes stay within the specified scale.

### Real-time Feedback
Pitch Detection Demo:

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd9e6e3f-85f1-42be-a6c8-b757da478854

The application provides real-time feedback by:
1. Capturing audio from your microphone
2. Detecting the pitch using FCPE (Fast Context-aware Pitch Estimation)
3. Converting the frequency to the nearest musical note
4. Displaying both the target note and your sung note in real-time
